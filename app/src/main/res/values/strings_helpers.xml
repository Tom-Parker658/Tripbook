        NB: Please, inorder to delete town(s), delete trip(s) or even delete your agency, you must plan in advance
        so that Bookers will not be able to bookers from your agency during that time. This is to avoid cases where a booker
        Books in advance a trip which will not exist in the future anymore or Books from an agency which will go off before the
        departure time. Please, understand that we want to protect all our customers interest.
        So it will not be good for Booker to pay for a trip which he will never consume.
        Thanks
